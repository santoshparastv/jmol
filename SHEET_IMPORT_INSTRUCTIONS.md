# How to Import Google Sheets Formulas

## Quick Method: Copy-Paste the Sheet

### Option 1: Copy Formulas Directly

1. **Open your Google Sheets**: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kwDlSYN2maubVvT8ccZZ9skqHkgis8cdJBTUvCQjQlc/edit
2. **Go to "CTC Auto Calculator" sheet**
3. **Select the entire calculation area** (all cells with formulas)
4. **Copy** (Ctrl+C or Cmd+C)
5. **Paste here** in the format below, or share with me

### Option 2: Export as CSV and Share

1. In Google Sheets: **File > Download > Comma Separated Values (.csv)**
2. Open the CSV file
3. Copy all the data
4. Share it with me

### Option 3: Share the Sheet (Easiest)

1. In Google Sheets: **Share** button (top right)
2. Set permissions to "Anyone with the link can view"
3. Share the link with me
4. I can access it directly and extract the formulas

## What I Need

Just share one of these:
- ✅ The Google Sheets link (with view access)
- ✅ The CSV export
- ✅ Copy-pasted formulas from the sheet
- ✅ Screenshot of the formulas (showing formula bar)

Once I have the formulas, I'll implement them exactly in the code!

## Format for Pasting Formulas

If you want to paste formulas manually, use this format:

```
Cell Reference | Component | Formula
B5 | Basic Salary | =NetSalary*0.4
B6 | HRA | =B5*0.5
B7 | Bonus | =B5*0.11
...
```

Or just paste the raw formulas - I'll figure it out!
